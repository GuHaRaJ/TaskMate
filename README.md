# TaskMate
TaskMate is a simple task management application built using C++. It allows users to add, view, delete, and sort tasks based on priority. The tasks are saved to a file and can be reloaded on the next program launch. This project demonstrates the use of file I/O, object-oriented principles, and sorting algorithms in C++.
